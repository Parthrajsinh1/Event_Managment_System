# Event Management System

---

## Overview

The **Event Management System** is a Spring Boot-based web application designed to streamline event-related data handling and management processes. It focuses on enabling efficient event organization, user management, and secure data operations through modern backend development practices.

This project demonstrates the implementation of a scalable and reliable backend architecture using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **MySQL**.
